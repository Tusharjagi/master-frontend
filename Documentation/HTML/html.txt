<!DOCTYPE html>  
This is the doctype declaration.  
It is not part of the HTML itself but a declaration that tells the browser to 
use HTML5 standards.  
Using the doctype ensures that the page is rendered in standards mode, 
following HTML5 rules.  
Without it, the browser may fall back to quirks mode, which can cause 
inconsistent rendering across different browsers.

  Always used inside <head>.
  Uses: character set, viewport, SEO, auto-refresh, social media preview, 
  browser compatibility.
